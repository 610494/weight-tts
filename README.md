note: should use len_free feat, follow Len_free Executing Inference 

### execut add_loss_weight_for_yourtts.py to get the weight in training

1. replace 22 lines in add_loss_weight_for_yourtts.py with the output of deep svdd model
2. replace 23 lines in add_loss_weight_for_yourtts.py with the output of mos result
3. python add_loss_weight_for_yourtts.py to get the weight for training

### weight yourtts training
